# Ecma International Standards

**prototype software! not yet working code**

Ecma has been involved in the development of the concept of "fast tracking" in ISO/IEC JTC 1 and - since its introduction in 1986 - it has been one of the main practitioners of it.

Ecma is driven by industry to meet the needs of industry, generating a healthy competitive landscape based on differentiation of products and services, rather than technology models, generating confidence among vendors and users of new technology.
